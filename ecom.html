    <h3>
      Motivations
    </h3>
    <p>
      For this hypothetical project, I used python and specifically the Django framework in order to create a fully functioning e-commerce site.
      It had the following functionalities:


  <ul id="listcom">
    <li>-Setup and project configuration</li>  
    <li>-Adding items to a cart</li>
    <li>-Creating an order summary</li>
    <li>-The checkout process</li>
    <li>-Handling payments with Stripe</li>
    <li>-Discount codes</li>
    <li>-Managing refunds</li>
    <li>-Default addresses</li>
    <li>-Saving credit card information</li>

  
</ul>


<p>
  I also used the following tutorials:

      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
Project Outlook</h3>
  
   
    The project would be a learning experience with me as I haven't exactly done backend programming during my time at Boston College.
    However, it would be rewarding as the skillset would help me apply to many different roles and allow me to hopefully one day design and launch
    apps.

    <h2>
    My Process
    </h2>
   
    <p>
I would watch the tutorials and try to emulate the code in my own IDE, while jotting down some notes on some function/syntaxes that are new.     <br>

    <h3>
      Struggles and Lessons
    </h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This was a bit of a challenging project as it would have taken a lot of time. It's a whole new framework and personally, 
          some online tutorials end up teaching very niche skills that do not necessarily translate well. There was a lot of 
          stack exchange and googling done in order to keep up.       </li>
       
   <li> Final thoughts: This was a learning experience, and of course, only a hypothetical project. But looking deeper into these tutorials, the framework, and how it is all implemented,
 I think it is actually very doable and I hope to tackle this in the future.
