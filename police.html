    <h2>Project Information</h2>

    <h3>
        Motivations
      </h3>
      <p>  Gun violence has been one of the top topics of concern for the United States. From mass shootings to police gun violence, the U.S. has been dealing with a recent surge in gun violence victims.


        Many of the reasons why people own a gun is because they feel unsafe, stemming from distrust in the police, who are meant to protect the people. We will highlight police shootings from 2015 to 2021.
        
        
        We will dive into the profile of the victims of those shot by the police around the United States as well as the circumstances surrounding the incidents in order to help readers understand the urgency and reality of the issue.

        <h3>Data Processing</h3>
        
     
        Generally, all of our data processing was done in cleaning the data. The
        dataset contained empty cells that would cause errors when implementing
        the data. So, for our visualizations to work more effectively, we wanted
        to include the "null" data. We filled in these blank cells with data
        describing the type of "null" value like "N/A" or "Undefined" or
        "Undetermined." This word selection was specific to the category that
        the blank cell was in. Once the data had no more blanks, it made the
        visualizations more accurate and easier to understand.
        <br />
        As part of our third visualization, we also had to create a rate of
        death ratio -- victims of a certain race divided by the total population
        of that particular race in each state -- to ensure that users make the
        observations that we intend. We wanted to show that there was a sample
        bias in the previous visualization based on the total population. In
        other words, it may appear that the number of white victims outnumber
        that of black victims, but this is because there is a larger white
        population than a black population. The rate displays a more accurate
        comparison because the frequency of victims are shown in respect to the
        size of the population. The states were also divided into different
        regions to display the regional data using color codes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Design Rationale </h3>
       
        To show and hopefully grant some insight into a very controversial
        issue, we created the following:
        <br />
        <br />
        1) An interactive force visualization where each node designates a
        victim of a police shooting. Most importantly, users can sort data by
        each of the 50 states, as well as create clusters to better understand
        the details of the incidents. We hope to show that there is trend within
        the incidents and the victims that can imply deeper issues that are related (causation or correlation) to 
        police shootings.
        <br />
        <br />
        2) A map that further tries to highlight the frequency of the issue
        throughout the United States by mapping incidents. The display of the dots on 
        the map of the country would communicate that this is a national issue. We hoped that users
        would find an interesting observation that many more whites seemed to be
        part of the data and question why it appears that way despite the claims that 
        Black communities suffer the most from police shooting. This line of 
        question would lead to the next visualization that shows and clarifies the potential 
        misconceptions that could be concluded from the map. 
        <br />
        <br />
        3) The bubble chart was a bit of data manipulation to highlight (as
        previously stated) a sampling bias in the map visualization. Although the map showed
        a greater number of white victims than that of minority victims, the ratio that we calculated (# of people killed / 
        total population for each respective race) showed that victims of color experienced
        police shootings at much higher frequencies.
        <br />
        <br />
        4) We explored data in terms of gender and tried to justify why the
        circumstances around shootings (as highlighted in visualization ) were
        the way that they were. If there were so many male victims, was there a
        correlation to them being armed and thus being percieved as a threat? We
        also embedded some outside research to back up our hypothesis.
        <br />
        <br />
        5 & 6) Finally, we created a tribute to the victims. First we create a
        scatterplot with an interactive bar chart that showed the victims by
        age- humanizing them and showing the loss of life. The bar chart allowed
        closer inspection by choosing a certain range and seeing the
        circumstances around the death in terms of whether the victim tried to
        flee- painting a more vivid picture of the incidents. The final bar
        chart is a way to just show a few of the names, ages, and gender of the
        victims by race to emphasize that despite this project, each data point
        is in fact, a person, and a catalyst to address a growing national
        issue.  
      </p>

        <h2>Our Process </h2>
      
        During the design planning phase, we explored many different
        visualizations. We experimented with treemaps along with bubble maps that would
        encode location and weaponary. However, we didn't find this to be
        personable enough as the tree map is a bit too general. Our goal was to hone in on
        specific details that would lead to insights about trends and patters in police shooting incidents. 
        
        <br />
        <br />
        We then decided to create multiple vizes that would encapulate not just
        the victim emphasis, but explore multiple elements as well.
        We began experimenting with many iterations of bar charts that would
        dictate and interact with other visualizations such as a bubble plot of
        some sort. From this, the force graph idea was born, starting
        with a general trend indicating visualization while incorporating a drop
        down menu with as much customizability as possible.
